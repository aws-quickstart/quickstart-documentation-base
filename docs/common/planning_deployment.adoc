This deployment guide requires a moderate level of familiarity with
AWS services. If you’re new to AWS, visit the
https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/[Getting Started Resource Center]
and the https://aws.amazon.com/training/[AWS Training and Certification
website]. These sites provide materials for learning how to design,
deploy, and operate your infrastructure and applications on the AWS
Cloud.

=== AWS account

If you don’t already have an AWS account, create one at https://aws.amazon.com/[https://aws.amazon.com] by following the on-screen instructions. Part of the sign-up process involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN using the phone keypad.

Your AWS account is automatically signed up for all AWS services. You are charged only for the services you use.

=== Technical requirements

Before you launch the Quick Start, your account must be configured as specified below. Otherwise, deployment might fail.

==== Resource Limits
// http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html[Resources] a|
If necessary, request https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-2#!/[service quota increases] for the following resources. You might need to do this if an existing deployment uses these resources, and you might exceed the default quotas with this deployment. The https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-2#!/[Service Quotas console] displays your usage and quotas for some aspects of some services. For more information, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html[AWS documentation].
// If we are checking used services, can we pull them in below automatically?
// - Yes.

// We can also pull in regions automatically.
==== Supported Regions

ifdef::template_not_all_regions[]
This deployment includes <service>, which isn’t currently supported in https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/[all AWS Regions].
endif::template_not_all_regions[]

The following regions are currently supported by this Quick Start Reference Architecture.

include::../{generateddir}/regions/index.adoc[]

TIP: Certain regions are available on an opt-in basis. Please refer to the AWS Documentaiton on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html[Managing Regions] for more information.

==== EC2 Key Pairs

Make sure that at least one https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[Amazon EC2 key pair] exists in your AWS account in the Region where you plan to deploy the Quick Start. Make note of the key pair name. You need it during deployment. To create a key pair, follow the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[instructions in the AWS documentation].

For testing or proof-of-concept purposes, we recommend creating a new key pair instead of using one that’s already being used by a production instance.

==== IAM Permissions
//todo: scope of least-privilege
Before launching the Quick Start, you must log in to the AWS Management Console with https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html[IAM permissions] for the resources and actions the templates deploy.

The _AdministratorAccess_ managed policy within IAM provides sufficient permissions, although your organization may choose to use a custom policy with more restrictions.
