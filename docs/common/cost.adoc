You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running
this Quick Start reference deployment. There is no additional cost for
using the Quick Start.

The AWS CloudFormation template for this Quick Start includes
configuration parameters that you can customize. Some of the settings,
such as the instance type, number of Availability Zones, use of NAT
gateways or NAT instances (depending on the AWS Region you choose), and
amount of data that flows through the NAT device, will determine the
cost of deployment. To get an estimate, you can use the
http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html[AWS Simple Monthly
Calculator].

For pricing details, see the https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/[Amazon
EC2 pricing] and https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/[Amazon VPC pricing]
pages.

TIP: After you deploy the Quick Start, we recommend that you enable the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-reports-gettingstarted-turnonreports.html[AWS Cost and Usage Report]. This report delivers billing metrics to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket in your account. It provides cost estimates based on usage throughout each month and finalizes the data at the end of the month. For more information about the report, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-reports-costusage.html[AWS documentation].
